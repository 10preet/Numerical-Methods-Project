# Numerical-Methods-Project
This project consists the study of trading stock options which is a significant part of the financial markets. In the past, there didnâ€™t exist an efficient mathematical model to determine the value of an option. Thus, the Black Scholes model provides the analytical framework for options trading. The Black Scholes equation is a famous partial differential equation in financial mathematics. In this project, we discuss the solution methods for the Black Scholes model with European call and put options.
